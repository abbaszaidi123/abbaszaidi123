## About Me
I am Abbas Zaidi, a Senior Software Engineer with over 8 years of experience, currently working at AAC1 Enterprises Inc. I specialize in backend and full-stack development using Python (Django, Flask), Ruby (Ruby on Rails), Java (Spring Boot), and PHP (Laravel, Symfony), enabling me to build scalable, maintainable, and high-performance applications. My expertise includes designing RESTful APIs, integrating third-party services, and building end-to-end systems that support complex business logic and seamless user interactions. I have a proven track record of leading engineering teams, collaborating across departments, and driving projects from initial design through to production deployment. Iâ€™m also experienced with Docker for containerization, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure automation. Passionate about clean code, system design, and continuous learning, I strive to deliver impactful software solutions that align with both user and business needs.
